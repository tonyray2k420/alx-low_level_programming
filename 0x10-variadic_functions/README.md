This project demonstrates and describes a type of function known as vararg or variadic function. It can take varying number of arguments of varying types. This project entails the practical use cases of variadic functions.

Learning Objectives:

What are variadic functions
How to use va_start, va_arg and va_end macros
Why and how to use the const type qualifier
Requirements
