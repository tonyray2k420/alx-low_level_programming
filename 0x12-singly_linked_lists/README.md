This project demonstrates with practical examples the concept of singly linked lists data structure in C programming.

Learning Objectives:

When and why using linked lists Vs arrays
How to build and use linked lists.
Requirements:

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All files should end with a new line
Codes should adhere and use Betty style and documentation
No more than 5 functions per file
The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc...is forbidden unless otherwise stated.
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called lists.h
All your header files should be include guarded.
